👋 Hi, I’m Chris
- 🎓 I'm a physicist (PHD) working for a german startup in the medical imaging sector.
- 👀 I’m interested in developing and implementing molecular, metabolic acquisition and processing methods for hyperpolarized MRI.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create the best space for collaboration between academia and industry to translate research developments into the benefit for patients.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on MR pulse sequence designs, image reconstruction methods, medical image processing tools, and metabolic analysis algorithms. 
- 📋 I'm coding mainly in Matlab, C, C++, python and happy to learn any useful language.
